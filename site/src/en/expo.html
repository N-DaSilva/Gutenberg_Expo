        <h1>Why do we only talk about Gutenberg when we talk about printing ?</h1>
        <p class="p-bg">We mostly talk about Gutenberg because he perfected printing with metal movable type, thus making books accessible. But let's be honest, he didn't invent everything! The Chinese were already printing with wooden blocks centuries before him, and the Koreans even used metal movable type. Gutenberg just had the genius to make it more efficient in Europe and to make himself more famous!</p>

                The wooden pieces were hand-carved, which required time and precision. Their main disadvantage was rapid wear: the wood deteriorated with ink and humidity, making the prints less sharp over time.

                Gutenberg's pieces were made of metal, individually cast to form reusable movable type. Unlike wood, metal was more durable and allowed for sharper and longer-lasting prints. Its main advantage was modularity: a text could be easily recomposed without redoing everything, making printing much faster and more efficient.

                Today's printers use ink cartridges or toner to deposit text and images on paper. Unlike movable type, they can print any document in seconds without prior preparation. Their main drawback remains the cost of consumables, rapid obsolescence, and, of course, the infamous empty cartridges at the worst moment!

                First of all, printing was invented to transmit human knowledge and understanding. It democratized learning and collective knowledge, as well as the need to remember one's history and culture, to better build the present.

                And after printing? With the Internet era, this sector has taken a radical turn. Once a pillar of cultural preservation and knowledge transmission, it has gradually given way to digital. Printed books, newspapers, and encyclopedias have been supplanted by screens, where information circulates faster and reaches a wider audience. However, printing has not disappeared: it has adapted, focusing on quality editions, careful design, and print-on-demand. Today, it coexists with digital, offering a tangible alternative in an increasingly dematerialized world.
